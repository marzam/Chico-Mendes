# Chico-Mendes
Info:
Chico Mendes park illegal occupation simulation based on Cellular Automata is developed in two tools: python and C++. Python is responsible for manipulating geodataframe shp file format. Python also builds the CA lattice with discretization defined by the researcher. C++ module executes the simulation, allowing us to use HPC library C++ such as MPI, pthread, OMP, sycl, oneapi++, CUDA and so on.


- June 1st, 2021 -> Chico Mendes park illegal occupation simulation based on Cellular Automata.
                    This work is based on  Modeling urban expansion scenarios by coupling cellular automata model and system dynamic model in Beijing, China

- June 4th, 2021 -> Bugs fix. I have included the first approach of CA in related to illegal park occupation rules (probabilistic rule)
